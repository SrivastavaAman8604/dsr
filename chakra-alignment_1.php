						   Chakras are wheel shaped vortexes, spinning energy centers
						   located throughout your body that influence and reflect your
						   physical health as well as your mental, emotional and spiritual
						   wellbeing. They start at the tailbone and end at the crown. 
						   They are the focal point of transmission and reception of energies. 
						   There are seven main chakras that begin with the root, or base, 
						   chakra at the base of the spine, ascending in a column to the 
						   crown chakra at the top of the head. There are 7 major chakras,
						   energy centers, each corresponding to a specific vibrational 
						   frequency in the universe which influences our physical, 
						   emotional and spiritual well-being. When our chakras are
						   perfectly aligned with the universal flow of energy, every 
						   aspect of our life becomes harmonious and joyful.
						</p>
						<p>
						   All of your chakras must be open and clear in order to achieve 
						   optimum health and balance. As you become aware of your chakras
						   and learn to activate them, you can feel the energy flow through 
						   you, healing yourself and connecting to the cosmos. Open chakras 
						   allow energy to flow cleanly and easily, resulting in an increase
						   in energy and awareness along with arousing your natural intuitive 
						   abilities.

						    Personalized chakra healing sessions are uniquely designed 
						    to address the energetic needs of the individual. The first
						    step in designing a personalized chakra healing journey is
						    an evaluation of the current level of chakra activity and 
						    the flow of energy. When the chakras are functioning at their
						    optimum levels one feels light, happy and in harmony. 
						    Any over-activity or under-activity leads to blockages 
						    making the chakras unbalanced. Unbalanced chakras lead to 
						    dissonance within our physical, mental, emotional and 
						    spiritual bodies.

						    The second step is removing the blockages from the chakras to bring
						    them to their optimum levels of functioning. Harmonization is brought
						    through a combination of Energy healing techniques of Pranic Healing, 
						    Crystal therapy, Sound therapy, and focused affirmations.

						    The final step is integrating the new flow of energy. Techniques for 
						    anchoring the new vibration and recommendations for self-care are 
						    given to help create the new paradigm of how the individual sees
