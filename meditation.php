						   700 Million and rising. That is a large population of the world.
						   Over 700 million people across the world are suffering with mental
						   illness. The worldâ€™s biggest mental health problem is Anxiety.
						   These numbers are what is reported. How many more are suffering
						   in silence and far from receiving care. The new world has brought
						   with it busyness, the race for time, a need to achieve more, 
						   do more, be more. Pushing us to be living in the uncertainty 
						   of the future or the unresolved energy of the past.
						   We have forgotten as a human race to slow down.
						   To free ourselves from the chains of time.
						   To be in state of timelessness, to be here and now.
						   This very moment. 
						   That is MEDITATION.
						   To be present. To be here. 
						   The NOW.
						</p>
						<p>
						    I, too, am of this new world and as such I, too, was racing with
						    time, to achieve more and be more. In that race, my own mental, 
						    emotional and physical health somewhere got sidetracked and I
						    found myself at a pivotal place in my life, stressed about the
						    future, unable to let go of the past, feeling unfulfilled,
						    a box full of medicines and a body that was giving up.
						    Something had to change. Something HAS to change.
						    It was time for Judgment. A time for Renewal.
						    As I journeyed to the depths of my own soul, 
						    quietening the mind, being more present, 
						    I began to experience more peace and happiness.
						    Rigidity turned to flow. Busyness turned to stillness.
						    Achievement turned to contentment. Peace began to permeate my
						    thoughts, emotions and physicality. The journey of PRESENCE 
						    has been truly rewarding and life changing. 
						    It is this personal transformation that inspired me to
						    offer Journey Meditations to all seeking peace. I am an
						    intuitive guide and the journeys that I offer come from my soul.
						    These can be in groups or personal one-on-one journeys. 
						</p>
						<p>
						    Some of the journey meditations that I have offered included: 
						    Golden Light Meditation, Meditation for Mental Clarity, Meditation
						    for Connecting with Your Spirit Guides, Abundance Meditation,
						    Meditation for Harmony, Meditation for Positive Energy, Relaxation
						    & Peace, TwinFlame Meditation, Meeting Your Future Self.
						    Perhaps it is time to not compete with time? Perhaps it is 
						    time to watch the butterflies flutter, gaze at the snow capped
						    mountains, breathe the fragrance of the first rain, hear the 
						    ocean waves? Perhaps it is time to come back to your ownself. 
						    To a place of relaxation, contentment, peace and bliss.
						    Meditate and experience the nectar for yourself !
