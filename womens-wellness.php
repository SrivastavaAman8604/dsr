						    Mental Health among women is on the rise. 1 in 5 women experience
						    a common mental disorder. Traumas, expectations to achieve more, 
						    changing family relationships, re-balancing work & personal life,
						    coping with multiple co-occurring stressors, issues on sexuality,
						    aging, menopause and more all have a negative impact on a woman’s 
						    mental, emotional and physical health.
						</p>
						<p>
						   Pressures peaking in the 40s in every dimension of life from career, 
						   kids, marriage, friendships, caring for elderly parents – everything 
						   requiring more time creates tremendous levels of stress and challenges 
						   for women. There are great levels of sacrifices that a woman makes 
						   during her life in ‘making things work’ for the ones around her, be 
						   it her family, partner, or work. 
						</p>
						<p>
						    This dichotomy leaves her searching for Balance, Emotional Healing,
						    looking to have authentic Self -Expression and looking for meaning 
						    in her life, her Life Purpose. 
						    As a woman, I, too have navigated these treacherous arenas.
						    I have come to realize the deep need for women’s nourishment
						    on our planet. Through my own journey of discovering the true 
						    meaning of my life, healing emotional wounds, stiving for true 
						    authentic self-expression and consciously bringing Balance in
						    my life I have now come to place of greater freedom, contentment,
						    love for my own divine self. The rite of passage to honoring the
						    Divine Feminine energy within myself has been and continues to
						    be one of the most rewarding journeys.
						</p>
						<p>
						    It is with this deep honor, love and understanding that I have 
						    created special sessions for women’s wellness.
						    The Key to peace is to honor oneself.
						</p>
						<p>
						    Some of the past offerings included: Divine Feminine - Sacral 
						    Healing, Divine Feminine Full Moon Meditation, Goddess Ceremony,
						    Awakening the Sacred Feminine, Celebrating You.
