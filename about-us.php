I pursed a						    Master’s degree in business to improve my knowledge and skills.						    During my career I stumbled upon teaching and I was honored to 						    have served as an associate dean of an online university; then,						    onto helping entrepreneurs towards success managing a non-profit organization.						    I always had the passion for volunteering and I filled myself in service, 						    from in-class to fundraising, to leading parent groups in bringing business						    community and education together. A shift started to occur when I became a						    hospice volunteer. Nothing was the same after some intense experiences.						    Nothing was the same. I was now in a complete state of existential crisis.						</p>						<ul class="round1 ul-round">						    <li>Who am I? Really. </li>						    <li>Who am I? </li>						    <li>Why am I here? </li>						    <li>What is the meaning of life?</li>						    <li>What is life?</li>						    <li>What is my Life’s purpose?</li>						</ul>						<BR>						<p>						    To make sense of this (yes, my left-brain was in a state of shock) 						    I started reading, articles, books on spirituality, quantum physics,						    metaphysics, psychology, I started to learn Pranic healing and I also 						    undertook self-development courses. The one that impacted me the most was,						    <strong class="yellow strong">“Live Your Quantum Destiny” </strong>~ an 11 month deep journey with Dr. Jean Houston.						    This led to a period of deep self-discovery as I had made a 180 degree turn 						    from the corporate world transitioning into higher education to now a quest						    for my life's purpose.						</p>						<p>						    It was this adventure that has brought to life Divine Soul 						    Resonance by Archana.						</p>						<p>						    This is me, here and now! I am Archana, an Energy Healer, a Lightworker.						    I channel divine energy of love and light to help all in need. 						    Healing is a journey... unique to each one of us. It is my passion 						    and life purpose to provide spiritual guidance to help others on their 						    sacred journey. I use various healing modalities to empower &amp; rejuvenate 						    others &amp; bring wholeness and healing. I am an advanced Panic healer, Panic						    Psychotherapist, Crystal healer and an intuitive Oracle card reader.						</p>						<p>						    We are all physical, emotional, mental, energy beings of light and love.						    Divine Soul Resonance seeks to bring healing by helping release blocks and 						    opening up to the natural flow of energy to create a greater sense of						    well-being and harmony. As we allow healing energy of love and light to						    flow through us we truly are connecting to our inner source and opening 						    up the infinite abundance and wisdom of the universe. What a glorious feeling!						    As we re-connect to our own Divinity we recognize the Divinity in others and we						    begin to create communities that build upon who we are at the core ~ with Love,						    Compassion, Kindness, Understanding…with Forgiveness ~ to ourselves and to all others. 						    It is then we begin to live from a state of joy, harmony and bliss. What a glorious						    moment!

There is a plethora 						    of choices, see what calls to you. There are workshops, weekly classes, small-group						    sessions, customized healing journeys, distance healing. It is through my YouTube 						    Channel, I bring some powerful conscious practices that one can use to bring in 						    healing; I offer oracle energy readings to channel the messages coming in through						    the Spirit. In my Blogs, I offer insights through my own healing journey to create 						    awareness and build a community made with love and understanding.
